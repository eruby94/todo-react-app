This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a barebones To-Do List Application used as a vehicle for learning the basics of the React framework.

Presently, the list will reset with every refresh of the page, and items may only be moved back from completed to in-progress.

Sure, I could put more time and effort into making this fancy, and higher-functioning, but why reinvent the wheel? This is merely a demonstration of understanding of basic concepts.
